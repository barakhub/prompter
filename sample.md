# While My Guitar

I look at you all
See the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor
And I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

I look at the world
And I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake
We must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

I look at you all
See the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
(Look) look at you all

Still my guitar gently weeps

## Hotel California

On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
This could be Heaven or this could be Hell
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year)
You can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
She calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
Please bring me my wine
He said, 'We haven't had that spirit here"
"Since 1969"
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said, 'We are all just prisoners here"
"Of our own device"
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
"Relax, " said the night man
"We are programmed to receive"
"You can check-out any time you like"
"But you can never leave!"

# לא ידעתי שתלכי ממני

לא חלמתי שתלכי ממני
בלי לומר מילה, בלי להזהיר,
לא חלמתי שפתאום יכני
רעם שכזה ביום בהיר.
ואני תמים, תמיד חשבתי
שמאושרים כמונו אין.
ובדמיוני לראות אהבתי
איך ביחד נזדקן.

קול קורא הלילה
אין עונה הלילה
ואת עצמי
איך אני שונא,
איך שאשתנה
בשבילך.

את היית דבר כל כך בטוח
כמו קפה בבוקר, כמו שינה.
לא הייתי לצידך מתוח.
לא פיתחתי דרך הגנה.
ואולי את עוד מעט חוזרת.
רק הלכת לקנות כמה דברים
ונלך לראות ביחד סרט,
או נחליט שנשארים.

קול קורא הלילה...

ואני תמים, תמיד חשבתי
שמאושרים כמונו אין
ובדמיוני לראות אהבתי.
איך ביחד נזדקן.

## Video Games

Swinging in the backyard
Pull up in your fast car
Whistling my name

Open up a beer
And you say, "Get over here
And play a video game"

I'm in his favourite sundress
Watchin' me get undressed
Take that body downtown

I say, "You the bestest"
Lean in for a big kiss
Put his favourite perfume on
Go play your video game

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?

It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And, baby, now you do

Singin' in the old bars
Swingin' with the old stars
Livin' for the fame

Kissin' in the blue dark
Playin' pool and wild darts
Video games

He holds me in his big arms
Drunk and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of

Watchin' all our friends fall
In and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playin' video games

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?

It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And, baby, now you do

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?

It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And, baby, now you do

Hmm, hmm, hmm
(Now you do)
(Now you do)
Now you do
(Now, now you do)
(Now you do)
(Now you do)
