## While My Guitar

I look at you all
See the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor
And I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

I look at the world
And I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake
We must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

I look at you all
See the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
(Look) look at you all

Still my guitar gently weeps

## Old Love

I can feel your body
When I'm lying in my bed
Too much confusion
Going 'round through my head

Makes me so angry
To know that the flame still burns
Why can't I get over?
When will I ever learn?

Old love
Leave me alone
Old love
Go on home

I can see your face
But I know that it's not real
Just an illusion
Caused by how I used to feel

Makes me so angry
To know now that the flame will always burn
Never get over
Know now that I'll never learn

Old love
Leave me alone
Old love
Go on home

Take me home, boys

Old love
Leave me alone
Old love
Go on home

## Still Got the Blues

Used to be so easy to give my heart away
But I found out the hard way
There's a price you have to pay
I found out that love was no friend of mine
I should have known time after time

So long, it was so long ago
But I've still got the blues for you

Used to be so easy to fall in love again
But I found out the hard way
It's a road that leads to pain
I found that love was more than just a game
You're playin' to win, but you lose just the same

So long, it was so long ago
But I've still got the blues for you

So many years since I've seen your face
Here in my heart, there's an empty space
Where you used to be

So long, it was so long ago
But I've still got the blues for you

Though the days come and go
There is one thing I know
I've still got the blues for you

## Iris

And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't want to go home right now

And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later, it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you bleed just to know, you're alive

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am

## Hold the Line

t's not in the way that you hold me
It's not in the way you say you care
It's not in the way you've been treating my friends
It's not in the way that you'll stay till the end
It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you do

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Whoa oh oh
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Whoa oh oh

It's not in the words that you told me
It's not in the way you say you're mine
It's not in the way that you came back to me
It's not in the way that your love set me free
It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you do

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Whoa oh oh
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Whoa oh oh

It's not in the words that you told me
It's not in the way you say you're mine, oooh
It's not in the way that you came back to me
It's not in the way that your love set me free
It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you do

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Whoa oh oh
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
(Love isn't always on time)
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
(Love isn't always, love isn't always on time)
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Whoa oh oh

## Eye in the Sky

Don't think sorry's easily said
Don't try turning tables instead
You've taken lots of chances before
But I ain't gonna give anymore
Don't ask me
That's how it goes
'Cause part of me knows what you're thinking

Don't say words you're gonna regret
Don't let the fire rush to your head
I've heard the accusation before
And I ain't gonna take any more
Believe me
The sun in your eyes
Made some of the lies worth believing

I am the eye in the sky
Looking at you
I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules
Dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind
And I don't need to see any more to know that
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind

Don't leave false illusions behind
Don't cry cause I ain't changing my mind
So find another fool like before
Cause I ain't gonna live anymore believing
Some of the lies while all of the signs are deceiving

I am the eye in the sky
Looking at you
I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules
Dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind
And I don't need to see any more to know that
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind

I am the eye in the sky
Looking at you
I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules
Dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind
And I don't need to see any more to know that
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind

## Hotel California

On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
This could be Heaven or this could be Hell
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year)
You can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
She calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
Please bring me my wine
He said, 'We haven't had that spirit here"
"Since 1969"
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said, 'We are all just prisoners here"
"Of our own device"
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
"Relax, " said the night man
"We are programmed to receive"
"You can check-out any time you like"
"But you can never leave!"

## חופשי זה לגמרי לבד

עשרים וארבע שעות ביממה
למדנו את ואני את כל החוכמה
לא ידענו ללמוד בעל פה
שאחד ואחד זה בעצם הרבה

עשרים וארבע שעות ביממה
בנינו חומה של בדידות איומה
אז הלכנו ללמוד כל אחד בנפרד
שחופשי זה בעצם לגמרי לבד
חופשי זה לגמרי לבד
חופשי זה לגמרי לבד

חופשי זה - חופשי זה לגמרי לבד
חופשי זה - חופשי זה לגמרי לבד

עשרים וארבע שעות ביממה
טעות חזרה בטעות על עצמה
מי ידע בסופו של חשבון
שאחד ואחד זה בעצם המון

חופשי זה - חופשי זה לגמרי לבד
חופשי זה - חופשי זה לגמרי לבד


אז הלכנו ללמוד כל אחד בנפרד
שחופשי זה בעצם לגמרי לבד
חופשי זה לגמרי לבד
חופשי זה לגמרי לבד

חופשי זה - חופשי זה לגמרי לבד
חופשי זה - חופשי זה לגמרי לבד

## לא ידעתי שתלכי ממני

לא חלמתי שתלכי ממני
בלי לומר מילה, בלי להזהיר,
לא חלמתי שפתאום יכני
רעם שכזה ביום בהיר.
ואני תמים, תמיד חשבתי
שמאושרים כמונו אין.
ובדמיוני לראות אהבתי
איך ביחד נזדקן.

קול קורא הלילה
אין עונה הלילה
ואת עצמי
איך אני שונא,
איך שאשתנה
בשבילך.

את היית דבר כל כך בטוח
כמו קפה בבוקר, כמו שינה.
לא הייתי לצידך מתוח.
לא פיתחתי דרך הגנה.
ואולי את עוד מעט חוזרת.
רק הלכת לקנות כמה דברים
ונלך לראות ביחד סרט,
או נחליט שנשארים.

קול קורא הלילה
אין עונה הלילה
ואת עצמי
איך אני שונא,
איך שאשתנה
בשבילך.

ואני תמים, תמיד חשבתי
שמאושרים כמונו אין
ובדמיוני לראות אהבתי.
איך ביחד נזדקן.

## Country Roads

Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

All my memories gather 'round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

I hear her voice in the mornin' hour, she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
Drivin' down the road, I get a feelin'
That I should've been home yesterday, yesterday

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

Take me home, (down) country roads
Take me home, (down) country roads

## Video Games

Swinging in the backyard
Pull up in your fast car
Whistling my name

Open up a beer
And you say, "Get over here
And play a video game"

I'm in his favourite sundress
Watchin' me get undressed
Take that body downtown

I say, "You the bestest"
Lean in for a big kiss
Put his favourite perfume on
Go play your video game

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?

It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And, baby, now you do

Singin' in the old bars
Swingin' with the old stars
Livin' for the fame

Kissin' in the blue dark
Playin' pool and wild darts
Video games

He holds me in his big arms
Drunk and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of

Watchin' all our friends fall
In and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playin' video games

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?

It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And, baby, now you do

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?

It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And, baby, now you do

Hmm, hmm, hmm
(Now you do)
(Now you do)
Now you do
(Now, now you do)
(Now you do)
(Now you do)

## Dram On

Every time that I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone
Oh, it went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way?

Everybody's got their dues in life to pay, oh, oh, oh
I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win

Half my life's in books' written pages
Storing facts learned from fools and from sages
You view the earth

Oh, sing with me, this mournful dub
Sing with me, sing for a year
Sing for the laughter, and sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

Oh, sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, and sing for the tear
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

Dream on
Dream on
I dream on
Dream a little, I'll dream on
Dream on
I dream on
I dream on

Dream a little, I'll dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
I'll dream on
Dream on
Dream on
I dream on
